# About
The **Antioch Mobile** app is a fully cross platform app whose sole purpose is to provide a mobile solution to better foster communication and connection with a local church congregation. 

The app includes:
## Home Page
The Home Page is the area of the app that houses all of the basic informationa and resources that the Church has to offer. It contains multiple pages of widgets that are connected to either website or other pertanent resources that will further edify the mission of Antioch Community Church. The Pages are:
- **Jesus**
Intimacy with Jesus is what makes us great. This page is where you will find all of the resources that deal with edifying a relationship with Jesus. It is were you will find all of our messages and where you can connect directly to our live stream.
- **Disciplship**
Not only are we called to be disciples, but we are called to make disciples. This page houses all of the appropriate resources that help to shepherd discipleship in within this body.
- **Family**
Here at Antioch we desire to be "A Family together on mission." This page is where you will find all of the information about how to get better connected to this church and to Life-Groups, which is the heartbeat of this church. 
- **Servee**
Sunday mornings are really more of a Family gathering at Antioch. It is a place where we gather together in order to worship Jesus as on body. That being said, it takes a lot just to be able to do this. That is why in this church we say "Everybody in!" This page will lead you to all of the ways that you can get connected and serve your family by making sunday morenings a wide open front door for the people of God worship!
- **Mission**
Because we are called to GO, Missions are a core component of life at Antioch. This page is where you will find access to all of the mission oportunities that that are available, as well as all of the details. 

## Events
This section of the app is where you will access to all of the events that are currently scheduled on the church calendar. Each time an event is scheduled at the church the app will update with the appropriate information for all current and upcoming events.

## Giving
This section connects directly to our online giving platform so that you can give directly from the app. 

## Notifications
This section of the app is was actually the inspiration of the app from the beginnning. While this app will not yet allow responses or real time messaging from its members, it will allow for the adminsistration of the church to send messages to each member of the churhc as an in-app message - and a push notification. This will allow for more real time communication to happen between the leadership of the church and each of its memebers.
